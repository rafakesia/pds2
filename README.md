# pds2
A small repository to save exercise files created on the semester of 2021-2 for the discipline of pds2.

VPL means 'Laboratório Virtual de Programação' - Virtual Programming Lab. 
VPL exercises were given to practice programming logic. 
Some exercises had statements provided to specify the way each code should be developed. 
Some others had the .hpp files provided for us to do the .cpp files.
